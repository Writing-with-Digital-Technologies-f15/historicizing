The video game functionalities of the &lt;canvas&gt; element invite game developers to join the web development scene, bringing with them ideals and practices from older video game forms to influence the diirection of HTML development.</li>

It's a tiny bit meta, but i'm curious to see as to how the formation of communication began and how it's beginning to change in HTML as well as across the web.The purpose of a historicizing project is to understand and discover how "vygotskyian concepts", or mediational means of writing affect our process of thinking. I hope that my project displays how thinking on the internet has changed through the means of comments in source code. </li>

                        <strong>Historicizing LZW Compression Algorithms</strong>:  Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) is a lossless data compression algorithm that was first published by Terry Welch in 1984 as a modification of the LZ77 and LZ78 compression algorithms developed by Jacob Ziv and Abraham Lempel (Duke). It is a dictionary based compression algorithm that is relatively simple for developers to implement and is widely used in GIF file formats (SFU).</li>

                        <strong>Flexbox</strong>: Flexbox is a layout module that’s goal is to provide an efficient way to arrange elements on a page. These elements are in a container and it is possible to layout, align, and distribute space among the items in the container without knowing their size. The main purpose of the layout is allowing the container to best fill the space provided, whether it be on a computer page or mobile screen. A flex container can expand or shrink items to either fill available space or prevent overflow. Thus, Flexbox is responsive and its current uses reflect its responsive capabilities.</li>

The box model is a div layout and was first introduced in CSS 1 as a formatting model. Revisions to the layout were added in CSS 2 and CSS 2.1. Developers consider two main reasons when deciding on either a table layout or a div layout for their website: ease of use and maintainability.</li>
